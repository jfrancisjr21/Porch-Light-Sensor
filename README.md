# Porch-Light-Sensor
This is my Embedded system final project. I utilized a TIVA C Series microcontoller alongside an Inland PIR Sensor to create a responsive Porch light sensor. 

This repository includes all components, design files, and the (main.c) source code used to program the microcontroller to read and output a response from the PIR Sensor. 



#SOFTWARE UTILIZED

- CURRENT LIMITING RESISTOR (330 --> 470 OHM)
- PIR INFRARED SENSOR
- 2 4-PIN BUTTONS
- JUMPER WIRES
     - MALE TO MALE
     - MALE TO FEMALE
     - FEMALE TO FEMALE

#TESTING 
After ensuring you have wired the entire circuit correctly you may connect your microcontroller to your computer and build and debug your code. If done correctly the LED should turn on and off in its inital state. Then after a 5 second delay the PIR sensor will be ready to read different heat signitures and display a response through the lit LED.
